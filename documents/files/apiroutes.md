# Api Routes

## Api best practices

- Error status codes
- Accept and return json
- No verbs
- Plural nouns to represent collections
- Singular nouns to represent individual resources
- Use query parameters to filter, sort and paginate collections
- Document your api
- Avoid requiring resource URIs more complex than collection/item/collection.
- Use HTTP headers to indicate the media type of the resource.
